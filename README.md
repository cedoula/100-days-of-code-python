# About

The #100DaysOfCode challenge is a journey to gaining skills in the programming world.<br>
I have chosen to master Python by building 100 projects in 100 days with Angela Yu's 100 Days of Python Pro. I will be uploading all progress to my [log](https://github.com/cedoula/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md).<br>
If you would like to follow me along this journey I will be posting daily updates on my Twitter: [@CedricVanza](https://twitter.com/CedricVanza)!
